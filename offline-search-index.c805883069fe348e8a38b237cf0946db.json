what’s the role of hidden and output layer? why we need a outputlayer? how the weight comes up?\nto explain those, let’s think about what the neural network is doing from first principles, we had input of every pixels, and output layer add all evidence and decide true or false\nthat’s quite simple, but where the evidence comes from?\nhidden layers provided evidence, and let’s concentrate on the first hidden neurons detects whether or not an image like the following is present\nIt can do this by heavily weighting input pixels which overlap with the image, and only lightly weighting the other inputs.\nthe same way, if other neural fired. we can get an 0 from output Exercise There is a way of determining the bitwise representation of a digit by adding an extra layer to the three-layer network above. The extra layer converts the output from the previous layer into a binary representation, as illustrated in the figure below.\nFind a set of weights and biases for the new output layer. Assume that the first 3 layers of neurons are such that the correct output in the third layer (i.e., the old output layer) has activation at least 0.99, and incorrect outputs have activation less than 0.01\nwe had input layer which hold pixels in grayscale, through hidden layer, we get output from output layer, as said, output closer to 1 can indicate the number. now add new output layer which convert old output to 0 or 1. we had map as below\nFor the first neuron, only digits 8 or 9 can be activated. This means that neurons 8 and 9 in the old input layer had a greater weight influence on the first neuron in the new output layer.\nThe same principle applies to other neurons.\nBut how do we determine the actual values of the biases and weights?\nThat doesn’t matter—we don’t need to manually design a set of weights or biases. Instead, we should understand that a node in the old output layer that is closer to 1 can be interpreted as having a positive influence. This influence is then mapped to the corresponding node in the new output layer.\nfor example we have neurons 8 closer to 1. and we fire first node in new output layer\nThe weights and biases are actually optimized by the system itself using a methodology called gradient descent.\n","categories":"AI","description":"","excerpt":"OK, let’s get into the real problem handwriting recognition\nFirst, …","ref":"/graphicsai/simpleclassifynet/","tags":["MachineLearning"],"title":"A simple network to classify handwritten digits"},{"body":"What is System There are two jobs mainly for system\nachieve goals MOST IMPORTANTLY add value to existing system A system generally contain 2 character, user and developer.

Like digits\nActually, these digits come from a well-known training dataset called the MNIST dataset, which contains tens of thousands of scanned images of handwritten digits along with their correct classifications.\nThe MNIST data is divided into two parts: Training and Test datasets. We primarily use the training dataset to improve the model’s accuracy and the test dataset to evaluate the model’s performance.\nFor simplicity, let’s simplify the process. In linear algebra, we know that multiple values can define a ‘dot’ in space. So, we transform the input layer into a vector (which we can think of as a dot), and then use a function to map it to the target value y.\nIn this case, y is the output, which ranges from 0 to 9. This means y is a 10-dimensional vector.\nAs for x, we simplify the entire input layer into a single notation: x. Let me explain further:\nx is a 28×28=784-dimensional vector. We define each pixel as an input neuron, and the vector represents the grayscale value of a single pixel in the image.\nSo, in this process, we map the 784-dimensional vector (input) into a 10-dimensional vector (output).\nturning a row vector into an ordinary (column) vector.\nActially, we want a method lets us find weights and biases, so that the output from the network approximates y(x) for all training inputs x.\nTo achieve that we introduce cost function\na simple explain here\nw denotes the collection of all weights in the network, b all the biases\nn is the total number of training inputs\na is the vector of outputs from the network when x is input, and the sum is over all training inputs\ncall C the quadratic cost function or mean squared error or just MSE\nC(w,b) is non-negative and mainly we can considerd as our training algorithm has done a good job if it can find weights and biases so that C(w,b)≈0\nOK, why we not just simply let y(x) deduct a?\nThe problem with that is that the number of images correctly classified is not a smooth function of the weights and biases in the network.\nwe can barly get infomation from that, That makes it difficult to figure out how to change the weights and biases to get improved performance. If we instead use a smooth cost function like the quadratic cost it turns out to be easy to figure out how to make small changes in the weights and biases so as to get an improvement in the cost.\nC(v) v This could be any real-valued function of many variables, v=v1,v2,…v=v1,v2,….\nTo minimize C(v) it helps to imagine C as a function of just two variables, which we’ll call v1 and v2 Fuction above is sample, the main idea is to find the minimize value However, calculus doesn’t work. beacuse we will have tons of variables in function far more than 2\nthere is a beautiful analogy which suggests an algorithm which works pretty well. We could do this simulation simply by computing derivatives (and perhaps some second derivatives) of C - those derivatives would tell us everything we need to know about the local “shape” and this is nothing with physics we just trying to find where derivatives stop.\nlet’s think about what happens when we move the ball a small amount Δv1 in the v1 direction, and a small amount Δv2 in the v2 direction.\nwith liner alog let’s try seprated changes in v to changes in C\nΔC can be rewritten as\nwhat’s really exciting about the equation is that it lets us see how to choose ΔvΔv so as to make ΔC negative. do not forget we keep tracing down the shape\nwhere η is a small, positive parameter，we called learning rate.\nwe indicate position by\nwhich will show in graph like “falling down”\nBut we have one problem here, we need to choose the learning rate to be small enough and approach good approximation. ==If we don’t, we might end up with ΔC\u003e0. If we don’t, we might end up with ΔC\u003e0.== At the same time, we don’t want η to be too small, since that will make the changes Δv tiny\nwith speed 0.03 we used 2495 steps and output curve relativly smooth\nwith speed 3 output curve is more abstract and reach a mini spot needs lucky\n","categories":"AI","description":"","excerpt":" our goal in training a neural network is to find weights and biases …","ref":"/graphicsai/gradientdescent/","tags":["MachineLearning"],"title":"Learning with gradient descent"},{"body":" refer: Using neural nets to recognize handwritten digits\npatience in the face of such frustration is the only way to truly understand and internalize a subject.

A way you can think about the perceptron is that it’s a device that makes decisions by weighing up evidence.\nBy varying the weights and the threshold, we can get different models of decision-making.\nwe’ll call the first layer of perceptrons - is making three very simple decisions, by weighing the input evidence.\nIn this way a perceptron in the second layer can make a decision at a more complex and more abstract level than perceptrons in the first layer.\nIn this way, a many-layer network of perceptrons can engage in sophisticated decision making.\nIn fact, they’re still single output. The multiple output arrows are merely a useful way of indicating that the output from a perceptron is being used as the input to several other perceptrons.\nsimplify one The first change is to write as a dot product\nw and x are vectors whose components are the weights and inputs\nmove the threshold to the other side of the inequality, and to replace it by what’s known as the perceptron’s bias\nbias can be seen as a way to measure how easy it is to get the perceptron to output a 1\nthe bias is a measure of how easy it is to get the perceptron to fire.\nit leads to further notational simplifications. Because of this, in the remainder of the book we won’t use the threshold, we’ll always use the bias.\n###### compute the elementary logical functions suppose we have a perceptron with two inputs, each with weight −2, and an overall bias of 3. the input 1 produces output 0, nputs 1 and 0 produce output 1 NAND gate!\nwe can use networks of perceptrons to compute any logical function at all.\nActually, in neural networks, a neuron has only one output, which is then broadcasted to all its outgoing connections.\nfor encoding input, we define a input layer, This notation for input perceptrons, in which we have an output, but no inputs. better to consider special units which are simply defined to output the desired values.\nIt turns out that we can devise learning algorithms which can automatically tune the weights and biases of a network of artificial neurons.\nSigmoid neurons we already know that our neural networks can simply learn to solve problems, automatically tune the weights and biases of a network of artificial neurons.\nThis tuning happens in response to external stimuli, without direct intervention by a programmer.\nhow can we devise such algorithms for a neural network?\nbefore design ourself, let’s see how network behave when a small change happen\na small change will cause a small corresponding change in the output\nthis property will make learning possible what we need is to make small change and let output closer to actual value.\nBut the problem is, when small change happens. output from perceptron more likely to flip like 0 -\u003e 1, That flip may then cause the output overcontrol and unpredictable\nThat’s where sigmoid neuron comes\nWe can overcome this problem by introducing a new type of artificial neuron called a sigmoid neuron\nSigmoid neurons are similar to perceptrons, but modified so that small changes in their weights and bias cause only a small change in their output.\noutput instead of 0 and 1 is where σ is called the sigmoid function or logistic neurons\nwe put it explicaitly\nwe can take the algebraic form as a technical detail than barrier of understatnding\nthe similarity to the perceptron model when z is large and positive, the output from the sigmoid neuron is approximately 1, On the Other hand the output is approximately 0\nthe behaviour of a sigmoid neuron also closely approximates a perceptron. Only z has a modest size that there’s much deviation from the perceptron model.\nIndeed, it’s the smoothness of the σσ function that is the crucial fact, not its detailed form.\nand we have another version\nIn that case, the the sigmoid neuron would be a perceptron since the output would be 1 or 0 (we ignore modest value) so sigmoid is basicly smoother version of perceptron\nIndeed, it’s the smoothness of the σσ function that is the crucial fact\nwe already know can be approximated by\nDon’t panic !!! Only the shape of fuction matters, actually we will talk more for other activation function\nwhere the output is f(w⋅x+b) for some other activation function f(⋅)\nΔoutput is a linear function of the changes Δwj and Δb in the weights and bias\nThis linearity makes it easy to choose small changes in the weights and biases to achieve any desired small change in the output.\nSo sigmod simulating perceptrons make it much easier to figure out how changing the weights and biases will change the output.\nAnyway, one big difference between perceptrons and sigmoid neurons is that sigmoid neurons don’t just output 0 or 1.\nExercises Sigmoid neurons simulating perceptrons, part I\nSuppose we take all the weights and biases in a network of perceptrons, and multiply them by a positive constant, c\u003e0. Show that the behaviour of the network doesn’t change.\nSigmoid neurons simulating perceptrons, part II\nSuppose we have the same setup as the last problem - a network of perceptrons. Suppose also that the overall input to the network of perceptrons has been chosen. We won’t need the actual input value, we just need the input to have been fixed.\nSuppose the weights and biases are such that for the input x to any particular perceptron in the network. Now replace all the perceptrons in the network by sigmoid neurons, and multiply the weights and biases by a positive constant c\u003e0.\nShow that in the limit as c→∞ the behaviour of this network of sigmoid neurons is exactly the same as the network of perceptrons.\nHow can this fail when w⋅x+b=0 for one of the perceptrons?\n","categories":"AI","description":"introduce Perceptrons and sigmoid","excerpt":"introduce Perceptrons and sigmoid","ref":"/graphicsai/neunet/","tags":["MachineLearning"],"title":"Neutral Network"},{"body":"You might know some pretty large perfect squares.

You may assume the argument is non-negative.\nhttps://www.codewars.com/kata/56269eb78ad2e4ced1000013\nTo be honest, there is no better way to utilize hardware instructions than by designing an algorithm yourself.\nHowever, we can use an existing algorithm here.\npublic static long findNextSquare(long sq) { // perfect number should end with 0, 9, 5, 4, 1 int back = (int)(sq % 10); // indicate input is perfect square or not if(back != 0 \u0026\u0026 back != 9 \u0026\u0026 back != 5 \u0026\u0026 back != 4 \u0026\u0026 back != 1 \u0026\u0026 back != 6){ return -1L; } // maybe a perfect number else{ // find square root // use repeated substraction int factor = 1, i = 0; while(sq \u003e 0){ sq -= factor; i++; factor += 2; } long sqrt = i+1; if(sq == 0) return sqrt*sqrt; else return -1L; } } Test cases\n@Test public void test1() { assertEquals(144, NumberFun.findNextSquare(121)); } @Test public void test2() { assertEquals(-1, NumberFun.findNextSquare(155)); } @Test public void test3() { assertEquals(320356, NumberFun.findNextSquare(319225)); } @Test public void test4() { assertEquals(15241630849L, NumberFun.findNextSquare(15241383936L)); } @Test public void test5() { assertEquals(-1, NumberFun.findNextSquare(342786627)); } @Test public void randomTest1() { long input = (long)(Math.random()*100000L)+1; long square = input*input; assertEquals(square+(input*2+1), NumberFun.findNextSquare(square)); } The key part is type conversion—we need to convert int to long. Be careful, as the result of our calculation may exceed the range of int.\nFor example:\nreturn (long) * (long);\nis different from\nreturn (long)(int * int);\nThe latter may cause a loss of accuracy.\n","categories":"","description":"You might know some pretty large perfect squares.
